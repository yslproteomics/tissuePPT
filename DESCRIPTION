Description: Tissue-PPT is a comprehensive resource that maps protein abundance (PA) and protein lifetime (PT) across eight mouse tissues and nine brain regions, providing in-depth insights into tissue-specific proteostasis. Using advanced proteomic techniques of data-independent acquisition (DIA) and tandem mass tagging (TMTpro), Tissue-PPT analyzed 11,000 proteins and 40,000 phosphosites with their PA and PT profiles, offering unmatched coverage and precision. Tissue-PPT uncovers e.g., tissue-specific short- and long-lived proteins, the role of phosphorylation in regulating protein stability, and how protein-protein interactions and organellar localization influence proteostasis and protein lifetime. By integrating multi-omics datasets, Tissue-PPT provides a detailed atlas of protein dynamics and tissue-specific regulation, offering new therapeutic insights. Accessible through an interactive web portal, Tissue-PPT serves as a valuable tool for studying proteome and phosphoproteome turnover in health and disease.
